// Traditionally we can findthe factorial of an number easily suppose factorial of 5 is 120 we can eaisly store it in INT
// but when it's comes to finding the factorial of 50 it will givve very large resullt and we can't store that in INT 
// so, we create an array of large integer value that will store the result of the factorial of 50;
