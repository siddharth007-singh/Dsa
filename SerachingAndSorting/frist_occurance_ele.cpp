// This Questionis same as "Frist repated element" in ->Best_question_array
// in that question we use unordered_list (hashMap) for finding the frist occurance of repeated element which is having 0(N) tc.

// In this question we will do the same thing woth wiht the help of BinarySeach to solve this quetion in 0(logN) tc.
